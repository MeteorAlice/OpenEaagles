Changes since v16.11
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General framework-wide changes and improvements

- Moved all players, systems and component-based models from simulation library
  into models library

- Moved all interoperability implementation code into a new 'interop' library.
  This effectively removes circular references between 'simulation', 'models'
  and 'interop' (i.e, interoperability) and 'otw' functionality.

- In simulation library, created mostly abstract interface classes for NetIO,
  Otw, Player, Atmosphere and Terrain.  They serve as the connection between
  simulation infrastructure (i.e., architecture) and models.  Moved all
  model implementation code into respective libraries -- models, terrain, otw.
  The goal is to divorce, simplify and focus the contents of the 'simulation'
  library to defining the basic architecture of a simulation.  It is now much
  less concerned about models and interoperability interfaces.
  In domain driven design (DDD) literature, this is called refactoring a ball
  of mud into more clear individual boundary contexts. In other words, simplify
  for understanding, clarity and general improvement.

- Grouped somewhat obvious highly related models into subfolders within the models
  library.  This includes folders for players, systems, dynamic models, environment,
  navigation, etc.  This can be improved, but it's a good start.

- Updated through replacement 0's with nullptr.

- In Object, the method getSlotByIndex() has been removed.  Therefore any derived
  Object-based classes no longer need to define it.  For legacy code, methods of
  the form below (in all class definitions), should be deleted.

   base::Object* <<CLASSNAME>>::getSlotByIndex(const int si)
   {
      return BaseClass::getSlotByIndex(si);
   }

   This change simplifies the codebase by eliminating unused methods and
   reducing code clutter.

- Old logger functionality has been removed in favor of binary data recorder
  library.  The classes base::Logger, simulation::SimLogger and simulation::TabLogger
  have been removed.

- Changed osg references from aliased types (e.g., Vec3, Vec4, Matrix) to proper
  declaration of Vec3d, Vec4d, Matrixd and removed Vec3, Vec4 and Matrix include
  files which did nothing but include other files and define aliases (via typedef).
  Using include files that do nothing but include other include files is considered bad
  practice -- this clarifies the codebase by making it more explicit.

base library

   Object class
     -- Removed getSlotByIndex() and getSlotByName() methods - both were unused.

   Component class
     -- component-based data logger functionality has been removed.  Removal of
        rippled into simulation library with the deletion of SimLogger and
        TabLogger classes.

   SlotTable class
     -- removed useless methods such as copyData, deleteData -- probably remnant
        from long ago, when it might have been an Object-based class.

otw library

- Much cleanup of this library by breaking out and making explicit all the OTW
  related code.  This included cigi classes now logically grouped within 'cigi'
  folder.

rpf library


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation library

   Otm class
      -- Renamed 'formName' slot to 'factoryName' to align code with this 
         termonology

   Player "interface" class - IPlayer
      -- Removed 2 undefined methods "isSmoothing()" and "getSmoothingRate()".
         Both were undefined and not used.

   Simulation class
     -- Changed slot name for 'irAtmosphere' to 'atmosphere' to be more general.
