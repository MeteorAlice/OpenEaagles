-- loadVector() allocated double array (p = new double[n]), but if no error, array never released.
-- see method setDataTable
-- loadData() -- consider using a C++ smart pointer to mgt memory to new double[] (unique pointer?)

Scan for places where std::err is being used, they are often near use of 'delete' is used -- consider
cleaning up code to use unique smart pointers.
