File: Table.cpp

-- loadVector() allocated double array (p = new double[n]), but if no error, array never released.
-- see method setDataTable
-- loadData() -- consider using a C++ smart pointer to mgt memory to new double[] (unique pointer?)

Scan for places where std::err is being used, they are often near use of 'delete' is used -- consider
cleaning up code to use unique smart pointers.


Things to review
---------------------------
Thread should not be an Object-based class
Should LinkedList<> template be based on Object? (same as other templates)
Should ref/unref concepts be in a separate class (or template?)
Should Color be in 'base' library?
Maybe move Color functions out of terrain class and temp subclass in mainTerrain example
utility functions should not have 'util' all over the places, in filename
