================================================================================
Changes since v14.01
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general

   1) Moved the declaration of LCreal from 'openeaagles/config.h' to
      'openeaagles/basic/support.h', since 'config.h' should only
      contain C pre-processor directives.

   2) Added std:: namespace qualifier to all string compare (strcmp) and exit calls
      This has no effect on API interface, but does make explicit where these functions
      are defined (for C++)

   3) Moving away from using C-style casts to more proper C++ casts throughout
      framework and examples.  No functional changes to the API or bugs have been found
      or resolved as a result of this activity.  We are simply adopting a better coding
      practice by making type casts more explicit in terms of the kind of cast being
      performed.

   4) Adding 'const' in more places within functions and methods where an intermediate
      value is calculated to support other calculations.  These variables are often created
      and used as a matter of convenience and never intended to be altered again after
      initial calculation.  This coding style promotes better visibility as to the
      purpose of variable, and provides more information so the compiler can make better
      optimizations because it knows the value will never change after initial assignment.
      No functional changes to the API or bugs have been found or resolved as a result of
      this activity - again, this effort is a result of adopting better coding practices.

   5) Added the shutdownNotification() function to more of the simulation classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic

   support.h
      1) Adding more explicit "std" namespace qualifiers and reducing the number
         of includes (e.g., cstdio, cstdlib, string)

   TcpHandler class
      1) recvData() was modified to check for closed connection or errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basicGL

   Image.cpp
      1) readFileBMP() -- Corrected the checks to properly reject files that are not
         bitmap files (bug fix) or other invalid files.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dis

   NetIO class
      1) processElectromagneticEmissionPDU() -- changed to only attempt to process
      the PDU if there were handlers provided.

   Nib class
      1) Added the shutdownNotification() function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui-glut

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maps


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
otw

   CigiClNetworkSignalProcessing class
      1) OnHotResp() -- added support for a CigiHatHotRespV3_2 type argument


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recorder


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation
 
   Autopilot class
      1) Removed old debug print statements

   Otw class
      1) compareKey2Model() -- Corrected null pointer check on pKeyFedName (bug fix)

   Player class
      1) Added accessor to get initial velocity setting - this allows dynamics models
         to quiz Player as to what initial velocity setting is on reset().

   StabilizingGimbal.cpp
      1) fixed slottable entry (bug fix)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vehicle

   Laero class
      1) Added reset method to initialize initial velocity using Player setting. This
         is effectively a bug fix as Player "initVelocity" was being ignored before
         (bug fix)
