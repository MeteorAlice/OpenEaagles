--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General framework-wide changes and improvements

   -- Renamed 'Eaagles' namespace to 'oe' to align with project name

   -- Renamed all camelcase-style namespaces to lowercase names - this aligns with
      common C++ conventions and avoids confusion with classnames

   -- Renamed 'basic' library to 'base' - 'base' and 'core' are very common names used
      by frameworks to define a base set of functionality provided on top of C++.
      This adjustment is designed to make framework look more standard in that regard.

   -- Renamed 'basicGL' library to 'graphics' - conveys purpose of library better, OpenGL
      is a means, displaying graphics is the intent.

   -- Renamed 'ioDevice' library to 'iodevice' - aligns better with all lowercase
      library names (more often done in Linux world)

   -- Renamed 'linearSys' library to 'linearsystem' - slightly more clear

   -- Created 'models' libraries, it now includes what used to be in 'dynamics' and
      'sensors'. This is the start of a fundamental effort to separate models from
      simulation infrastructure.

   -- Moved 'dis' directory into 'networks'.  This so that mulitple interoperability
      interfaces can be logically grouped together.

   -- Added hla interoperability library to 'networks' directory.

   -- Removed legacy support for 'formnames' in base Object

   -- All form functions and Factory classes have been removed -- should use 'factory'
      functions.  This is a bit of a reversal from Factory objects that defined a
      single static method for object creation as is common in the Java world, but then
      again, Java is pure OO programming language, C++ is a multi-paradigm programming
      language.  Standalone functions can be defined, so take advantage of it.

   -- Renamed global framework configuration options to start with 'OE' instead
      of 'EAAGLES'

   -- LCreal (which has been typed as 'double' for years) has been completely removed and
      replaced with 'double'

   -- Closely associated with LCreal is the macro "LCREAL_DOUBLE" which defined whether or not
      LCreal was defined as a 'double' or 'float' -- this macro has been eliminated.

   -- Replaced fundamental lc prefixed math macros (e.g., lcSin) with std equivalents
      (e.g. std::sin) to reduce unnecessary code and improve clarity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base library

   -- removed legacy support for factory names "BroadcastHandler", "MulticastHandler",
      and "UdpHandler" - instead use more explicit "UdpBroadcastHandler", "UdpMulticastHandler"
      and "UdpUnicastHandler" factor names.

   -- separated MonitorMetrics class definition and implementation away from Cie.h/cpp file.
   
   -- broke out everything defined by old 'support.h/cpp' and replaced grouped functionality
      into files located in subdirectory 'util' - meaning utilities.  Base Object no longer
      imports everything that was defined in 'support.h', classes now include only what is
      needed.
      
   -- almost all 'support.h' functions are now defined in scope of 'base' namespace - no
      longer are they global (i.e., scoped) to all of 'oe'.  The combination of grouping
      functionality into individual related utility files and more explicity including
      them (e.g., #include "openeaagles/base/util/system.h") in combination with more
      explict references to them (e.g., base::msleep) makes it more obvious as to where
      they are defined and only defined where needed.

   Number class
     -- replaced constructor to handle defined 64-bit 'Integer64' datatype to standard
        64-bit integer 'int64_t'

maps library

models library

   JSBSimModel class
      -- Added new slot parameter ('debugLevel') to set the debug level for JSBSim
         model instance. This controls the verbosity (i.e., output printed to console)
         of the model itself.  Slot parameter accepts an integer value.
